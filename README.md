Automated Weather Bot

An automated weather bot using java and a localized smpt server.

This script can be run any time to forward the mail to the smtp client.

In this example, the overall weather forecast , maximum temperature and minimum temperature are sent as a mail.

I have used PostCast as my local smtp server. You may use any other local server or host in on the cloud by tweaking the host and port properties in the WeatherManager.java file
